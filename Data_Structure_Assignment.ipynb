        "2. Performance: Using immutable keys ensures that the dictionary can maintain its performance characteristics (O(1) average time complexity for lookups). If keys were mutable, rehashing would be required each time a key changes, leading to inefficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reliability: Immutable keys ensure that dictionaries behave predictably. If mutable objects were allowed as keys and their contents changed, it would become difficult to trace issues, as keys could become unfindable in the dictionary.\n",
